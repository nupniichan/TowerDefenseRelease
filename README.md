# **My First Unity Game: Tower Defense**

## Overview

Welcome to **My Tower Defense Game**! This project showcases my journey into game development using Unity, inspired by the ***Tower Defense course by Brackeys***. This game is the result of my dedication to learning and honing my skills in game design and programming.
